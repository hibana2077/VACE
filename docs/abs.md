Below is a "small, complete, and runnable within a week" WACV paper topic and skeleton. **Only the CE loss is modified, fully supervised, with extremely low computational and memory overhead**, and **can be directly applied to all `timm` CNN backbones** (extract features via `forward_features/feature_forward()`; if the classification head needs replacement, only the last layer is changed).
I also use the UFG/Ultra-FGVC literature you provided to define the research scenario (large intra-class variance, extremely small inter-class difference), and reference existing CE improvements (label smoothing, LDAM, etc.) to position the novelty and feasibility of this work. ([arXiv][1], [papers.neurips.cc][2]) ([arXiv][3], [papers.neurips.cc][4])
Additionally, `timm`'s classification head and feature extraction APIs (`get_classifier`/`reset_classifier`, `forward_features`) directly support this "only change loss / only change last layer" implementation. ([pypi.org][5], [GitHub][6], [timm.fast.ai][7])

## Paper Title (WACV Style)

**VACE: Variance-Adaptive Cross-Entropy for Ultra-Fine-Grained Visual Categorization**

> A **class-wise temperature** cross-entropy, using **extremely lightweight intra-class scatter estimation within the batch**, simultaneously **relaxing intra-class tolerance** and **preserving/enlarging inter-class decision boundaries**, specifically designed for the **Ultra-FGVC "large intra-class, small inter-class" challenge**. UFG benchmarks show large intra-class variation, small inter-class difference, and few samples; this method works with **single supervised forward pass**.

---

## Core Research Problem

Ultra-FGVC (e.g., UFG leaf datasets) exhibits **significant intra-class variation** and **minimal inter-class difference**. Under few-shot conditions, standard CE uses a **single temperature** for all classes, leading to **overconfidence**, **underfitting hard classes**, or **overfitting easy classes**, resulting in poor generalization to new samples.

---

## Research Objectives

1. Design an **extremely lightweight modification applied only before CE's softmax**, giving **each class its own temperature $\tau_c$**, automatically adjusted by **intra-class scatter**.
2. **Without contrastive learning**, **no increase in feature dimension/memory**, **no extra forward/backward passes**, improve Ultra-FGVC recognition and calibration.
3. **Generalizable to all `timm` CNN backbones**; if the classification head needs modification, simply extract features via `forward_features/feature_forward()` and add a linear classifier. ([pypi.org][5], [GitHub][6])

## Method Overview: **VACE (Variance-Adaptive Cross-Entropy)**

* For sample $i$ with logits $z_i\in\mathbb{R}^K$, true label $y_i$, and estimated **intra-class scatter** $\sigma_c^2$ (estimated by **batch-wise** or **sliding EMA** inverse first moment, only **one scalar per class**):

    $$
    \tau_c = \mathrm{clip}\!\Big(a + b\,\sigma_c^2,\, \tau_{\min},\, \tau_{\max}\Big),\qquad c=1,\ldots,K.
    $$

* Define loss with **class-wise temperature softmax**:

    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{VACE}}
    = -\log \frac{\exp\left(z_{i,y_i}/\tau_{y_i}\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\exp\left(z_{i,k}/\tau_{k}\right)}.
    $$

    Intuitively: **Classes with large intra-class variation** ($\sigma_c^2$ large) → $\tau_c$ large → **distribution is "cooled"**, **higher tolerance for boundary samples**; **classes with small variation** → $\tau_c$ small → **sharper decisions** and **larger geometric margin**.
* Cost: Only adds **one scalar $\tau_c$ per class** and **one division**, **computational/memory cost nearly identical to CE**.

> Relation to prior work: Label smoothing changes **label** distribution, LDAM adjusts logits with **fixed margin**; VACE uses **data-driven, class-dependent temperature** to scale **logits**, a **minimally invasive reparameterization of CE**, avoiding contrastive learning or large memory. ([arXiv][1], [papers.neurips.cc][2])

## Mathematical Theory and Key Properties (Main Text + Appendix)

### 1) Relation to Standard CE (Interpretability)

Define $\tilde z_k = z_k/\tau_k$. Then

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{VACE}}(z;\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_K) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}(\tilde z).
$$

* Since $\tilde z$ is **class-wise linear scaling** of $z$, softmax **convexity** is preserved, and when $\tau_k\equiv 1$ it reduces to CE.
* **Decision boundary** in binary case is given by $z_a/\tau_a = z_b/\tau_b$; when $\tau_a<\tau_b$, boundary shifts toward class $b$, equivalent to imposing **larger effective margin** for "small variation" classes, and **relaxing** for "large variation" classes (avoiding overfitting).
    (Similar in spirit to LDAM's fixed $m_c$ margin, but VACE's margin comes from data $\sigma_c^2$ and does **not require batch strategy changes**.) ([arXiv][3], [papers.neurips.cc][4])

### 2) Gradient Form and Stability

Let $p'_k = \frac{e^{z_k/\tau_k}}{\sum_j e^{z_j/\tau_j}}$. For $z_k$:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\text{VACE}}}{\partial z_k}
= \frac{1}{\tau_k}\big(p'_k - \mathbb{1}[k=y]\big).
$$

* **Gradient magnitude** is modulated by $1/\tau_k$: **hard classes ($\tau$ large)** have **smoother gradients** near boundaries, reducing overfitting; **easy classes ($\tau$ small)** get **sharper updates**, improving discrimination.
* Since it's just **class-wise scaling**, numerical stability is same as CE, and can use CE's **log-sum-exp** stable computation.

### 3) Calibration and Upper Bound

* For classes with $\tau_k>1$, VACE **mitigates overconfidence**, similar to label smoothing's **improved calibration**, but VACE **does not change labels**, only logits temperature, thus **does not affect supervision signal**. ([arXiv][1], [escholarship.org][8])
* $\mathcal{L}_{\text{VACE}}\le \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}} + \max_k\log\tau_k$ (from $\log \sum e^{z_k/\tau_k} \le \log \sum e^{z_k} + \log \max_k \frac{1}{\tau_k}$), showing **no uncontrolled degradation**.

### 4) Unbiased Estimation and Overhead of $\sigma_c^2$

* $\sigma_c^2$ is estimated from **batch features** $f_i$'s **second central moment** (extracted via `feature_forward/forward_features`), aggregated per class using **indicator**, then updated via **EMA** (coefficient $\rho \in [0,1]$). Only **one scalar per class**, **O(K)** memory.
* **No extra forward pass**, **no need to save full batch feature maps** (just use global pooled feature, available in `timm`), **same time/memory complexity as CE**. ([pypi.org][5])

## Fit to Data Characteristics (Why It Works)

UFG/Ultra-FGVC is empirically **large intra-class variation and small inter-class difference**, with many subsets having **very few samples per class**; existing benchmarks show even strong methods are limited by this. This method directly injects **intra-class scatter** into CE's **logits temperature**, **without contrastive or extra memory**, reducing overfitting for "hard classes (large variation)" and expanding effective margin for "easy classes (small variation)", directly addressing this structural challenge.

---

## Implementation Details (for `timm` CNN, fully supervised)

* **Skeleton**: `features = model.forward_features(x)` (or your `.feature_forward()`), then linear classifier $W\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times K}$ gives $z=W^\top f$. At the loss, apply $z_k \mapsto z_k/\tau_k$ before CE.
* **Classification head replacement**: Use `get_classifier()` to get last layer; to unify dimensions or switch to bias-free linear layer, use `reset_classifier(num_classes)`; backbone modification is not required. ([pypi.org][5], [GitHub][6])
* **$\sigma_c^2$ estimation**: For batch samples of same class, compute pooled feature mean/variance (Welford/EMA), **O(Bd)**; update $\tau_c$ with **clip** for stability (suggest $\tau_{\min}=0.5, \tau_{\max}=2.0$).
* **Hyperparameters**: $a,b$ can be grid-searched on validation set, or fixed as $a=1,b=\lambda/\overline{\sigma^2}$ ($\overline{\sigma^2}$ is initial class mean), $\rho=0.1\sim0.3$.

---

## Comparison with Existing CE Variants (Positioning)

* **Label Smoothing**: Changes labels, improves calibration but not sensitive to **intra-class scatter**; VACE changes logits, **class-adaptive**. ([arXiv][1], [papers.neurips.cc][2])
* **LDAM/DRW**: Designed for long-tail/imbalance, margin depends on **frequency**; VACE's "margin effect" is determined by **scatter**, effective in **equal-frequency but varying difficulty** Ultra-FGVC scenarios. ([arXiv][3], [papers.neurips.cc][4])

---

## Evaluation Plan (Directly Use UFG Protocol)

* **Data**: UFG (SoyAgeing / SoyGene / SoyLocal / SoyGlobal / Cotton80).
* **Setup**: Follow original paper's data splits and training strategy, fair comparison with CE, Label Smoothing, LDAM.
* **Backbones**: Multiple `timm` CNNs (e.g., ResNet-50, ConvNeXt), verify **generality** and **equivalent overhead**. ([timm.fast.ai][7])
* **Metrics**: Top-1, ECE/calibration curves, stratified performance on different subsets (large vs small sample).

---

## Feasibility Self-Check (Theory + Engineering)

1. **Theory**: VACE=CE on scaled logits; convexity and convergence same as CE; simple gradient formula, interpretable boundaries.
2. **Engineering**: Only adds $K$ temperature scalars and one scalar division; **no contrastive sample bank, no extra feature map cache**; nearly same speed as CE.
3. **Fit to data**: UFG confirms **large intra-class, small inter-class**; VACE's $\tau$ is directly driven by **intra-class scatter**, improving generalization under **supervised** setting.

---

## Possible Appendix Experiments (Small but Convincing)

* **2D synthetic data** showing effect of different $\tau$ on decision boundaries.
* **Ablation**: Fixed $\tau$ (=1) → standard CE; replace scatter with **frequency** (LDAM style) → less effective for equal-frequency data; remove EMA, use batch stats only → more oscillation.
* **Efficiency**: Memory/time comparison table with CE (multiple backbones), proving "almost zero overhead".

### Abstract (Ready for Submission)

*We propose VACE, a variance-adaptive cross-entropy that introduces class-wise temperatures estimated from extremely lightweight intra-class scatter. VACE preserves the efficiency and memory footprint of standard CE while improving generalization under the large intra-class / small inter-class regime of Ultra-FGVC. The loss is convex in logits, reduces to CE when all temperatures equal one, and yields an interpretable, data-driven margin effect. Extensive experiments on the UFG benchmark across multiple timm CNN backbones demonstrate consistent gains over CE, label smoothing, and LDAM, with virtually zero extra overhead.* (**Cite UFG evidence**: UFG scale and challenge; **fully supervised**, no contrastive module.)

<!-- ## What You Can Do Right Now

* I can package the **VACE** **PyTorch loss function** (with EMA $\sigma_c^2$ estimation, `timm` example) for you, so you can directly replace `CrossEntropyLoss` in your training framework; interested?
* You can also run a quick comparison (CE / Label Smoothing / LDAM / VACE) on **ResNet-50 (`timm`) + SoyLocal/SoyGlobal** to confirm trends before scaling up. -->
